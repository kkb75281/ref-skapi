# Instructions

Build a complete web application using static HTML files with backend functionality powered by Skapi.

# Requirements

## Backend Integration

- Use the Skapi API to implement all backend features
- Refer to the Skapi API documentation: https://docs.skapi.com/skapi.md
- If there is a Skapi API documentation file `skapi.md` in the project, refer to that file instead.
- When working with Skapi methods, always check parameter and return data types from the Skapi Data Types documentation: https://docs.skapi.com/skapi-types.md
- If there is a Skapi Data Types documentation file `skapi-types.md` in the project, refer to that file instead.

**Important:** First read the entire API documentation carefully, then make informed decisions about implementing backend features. If the file is too big, read the file in chunks.

If the service ID and owner ID are not provided, always ask for them before proceeding.

## Implementing 3rd Party APIs

If the application needs to call 3rd party APIs requiring secret keys:

1. If the client secret key name configured in Skapi is not provided, always ask for it before proceeding.
2. Confirm whether the client secret is public or private:
   - **Public:** User login is not required
   - **Private:** User login is required before use
3. Use `skapi.clientSecretRequest()` with the provided secret key name to make requests to 3rd party APIs.

## Coding Guidelines

- Always pass HTML form `onsubmit` events directly to the Skapi API method if the method takes `SubmitEvent` as the first argument. Note that not all Skapi API methods accept `SubmitEvent` as an argument.
- Always verify data types and structure from the documentation when using the Skapi API.
- Use defensive programming practices when accessing data fetched from the database.
- Handle potential `null`/`undefined` values and implement proper error handling.
- When using `postRecord()` or `getRecords()` methods of the Skapi API, make sure to follow the special character restrictions for the `index`, `tag`, and `table` parameters.

## Page Routing and Navigation

- Set the starting page as `index.html`.
- Ensure all form actions point to their correct destination pages so the application functions correctly when opened locally (e.g., via the `file://` protocol).

## Authentication and Initialization

- Each HTML page must initialize the skapi-js library on load.
- Implement login state checks on each page.
- Redirect unauthenticated users when accessing restricted pages.

## Styling Guidelines

- Use a modern, material-style design unless requested otherwise.
- Ensure buttons and input elements are sized appropriately to match current UI standards.
- Use consistent box-sizing (e.g., `border-box`) to prevent layout issues, especially for elements with `width: 100%`.
